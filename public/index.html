            <p>The truth is&#44; mainstream media and the health industry set the bar 
            pretty high with &#34;examples&#34; of what we &#34;should&#34; all strive for when it 
            comes to the &#34;ideal&#34; body and how to achieve it. <br><br>
    
            If you are honest with yourself&#44; I&#39;m sure you will agree that on
            more than one occasion you looked at these &#34;examples&#34; and said&#44; 
           <span class="spantxt1" style="color:#000;"> &#34;I wish I looked like that.&#34;</span>  
           It&#39;s ok to admit this; I have been 
            in your exact shoes &#40;more on this in a moment&#41;.<br><br>
    
            I bet your next thought was&#44; <span class="spantxt1">&#34;How do I do this&#63;&#34;</span><br><br>
    
            Now&#44; there are literally unlimited &#34;guides or tips&#34; that you can 
            follow when trying to find some direction for your weight loss goals… 
            however&#44; the more you dig into these &#34;guides&#34; or &#34;tips&#34;… the more 
            confused you become.  <br><br>
    
            The point of frustration comes from <strong>ALL</strong> the conflicting information 
            on how to exactly achieve your <strong>&#34;perfect body.&#34;</strong> From magazine articles… 
            to TV commercials with workout gadgets and gizmos… to a diet plan that 
            simply does not work… there is just a CLUSTER of information&#44; and of course&#44; 
            each one claims that it&#39;s a &#34;NEW weight loss breakthrough&#33;&#34;<br><br>
    
            Let&#39;s not sugarcoat things; 99&#37; of this information is straight up BS&#33;<br><br>
    
          <strong>And if there&#39;s one thing I hate&#44; it&#39;s BS&#33;</strong></p>

            Hi&#44; my name is <strong>Kyle Bonnstetter</strong>&#44; and a few years ago&#44; I was 
            your average desk&#45;job junkie&#44; slowly watching my youth &#40;and trim 
            waistline&#41; disappear. You see&#44; I hadn&#39;t been in good shape since my 
            college days&#44; and I truly was not living up to my potential. <br><br>
    		<img src="images/img2.jpg" alt="" class="img-mob">
            I tried just about every diet plan and workout routine I could find&#44; 
            and I bought every weight loss pill that crossed my path.  Every once 
            in a while&#44; I would manage to lose a little weight. But the minute I 
            started eating &#34;normally&#34; again&#44; I would gain it all back… and then some.  
            I would get angry with myself&#44; throw in the towel&#44; and say&#44; “Who cares&#63; 
            I&#39;ll start the new diet tomorrow”…and then I would polish off a large pizza 
            and wash it down with a soda or a few beers.  This lifestyle had me <span class="spantxt2">TIRED&#44; 
            FAT&#44; and FRUSTRATED&#33;</span><br><br>
            
            Finally&#44; after I finally became sick and tired of being sick and tired&#44; 
            I learned how to lose weight the right way… it was simple and easy&#45;to&#45;follow. 
            People I worked with noticed I was losing weight within the first 7 days&#33; And 
            after just 28 short days&#44; I noticed my abs <strong>&#34;re&#45;emerging.&#34;</strong>  
            The fat started to 
            melt away&#44; and almost daily&#44; the scale moved downward&#44; as the pounds plummeted.</p>
            
            <p class="txt5"><img src="images/img3.jpg" alt="" class="lftimg">
            Ultimately&#44; I lost 37 pounds in less than 12 weeks&#33;</p>
            <img src="images/img3.jpg" alt="" class="img-mob">
          <p>The results went way beyond just weight loss… I noticed a HUGE 
            spike in my energy levels&#44; and both my professional and personal 
            life started to truly <strong>&#34;TAKE&#45;OFF&#33;&#34;</strong><br><br>
    
            I used to hate taking pictures; maybe you can relate. I would look 
            at them ashamedly and think… <strong>&#34;OMG I look awful&#33;&#34;</strong> But not 
            anymore…my confidence and self&#45;esteem have never been higher&#33;</p>

                	<li>I want to lose 20 pounds of fat. </li>

                </ul>
          </div>
          <p>According to psychologist and best&#45;selling author Richard Wiseman&#44; 
          your goals should be:</p>
          <p class="txt7 hidden-xs"><span>S</span>pecific <img src="images/space.png" alt="">
          <span>M</span>easurable <img src="images/space.png" alt="">

          <p>Speaking of time&#45;based&#44; after you identify your goal&#44; you&#39;ll 
          want to set a deadline… I recommend setting a 90&#45; to 120&#45;day deadline. <br><br>

		  I know you have heard this before&#44; but it is critical you WRITE down 
          YOUR goals&#33;  I know what you are thinking… <span class="spantxt3">&#34;I don&#39;t have to write these 
          down. I will remember.&#34;</span></p>
          
          <p class="txt4">Sorry…That NEVER WORKS…</p>
          
          <p><strong style="color:#561d92;">Here&#39;s why…</strong> take&#44; for example&#44;
          when you are heading to the 
          grocery store to get a few things&#44; like eggs&#44; milk&#44; bread&#44; mustard&#44; 
          and brown sugar. Before you leave&#44; you know exactly what you are 
          heading to the store for&#44; so you don&#39;t write them down.<br><br> 

	      I think you know where this is going… You get home&#44; and you 
          realize you forgot the mustard&#33; Dang it&#33;&#33;<br><br> 

		  Now&#44; let&#39;s think about the time you actually WROTE down what 
          you needed at the grocery store… Hmmmmmmmm&#44; I bet you came home 
          with everything checked off.<br><br> 

		  It&#39;s simple; writing down goals keeps you accountable&#44; and it 
          also sharpens your focus by setting a clear purpose&#45;intention.  
          Setting a specific goal and writing it down is the first step 
          toward success. </p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="contentwrap">
  	<div class="row mid1">
    	<div class="col-xs-12">
        	<p>Let&#39;s consider these two points…<p>
                <ul class="imglist">
            	<li><img src="images/img9.jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li><img src="images/img10.jpg" alt=""></li>
            </ul> 
            
            <p>With that in mind&#44; I think it&#39;s safe to say that proper 
            hydration has the potential to have an immense impact on 
            your daily life.<br><br>     
            
            <p>The truth is being dehydrated by as little as 1 to 2&#37; 
            of your body weight can impair both mental and physical function&#44; 
            leading to a suppressed metabolic rate &#40;calorie burn&#41; and reduced fat 
            burning.  Not only that&#44; fatigue and weakness are a direct result of 
            even mild dehydration.<br><br>
            
            The key is to drink water even when you&#39;re not thirsty. 
            Thirst signals may be unreliable&#44; and by the time your body 
            clues you in&#44; &#34;Give me a drink&#34;… you&#39;re already too low. Not 
            only that&#44; some folks tend to confuse hunger with thirst&#44; leading 
            them to eat unnecessarily when their bodies are actually looking 
            to be hydrated.<br><br>
            
            Hydration needs vary depending on the individual&#44; activity 
            level&#44; health conditions&#44; and the heat and humidity of your 
            environment.  In general&#44; <span class="spantxt4">the Institute of Medicine 
			recommends about 9 cups of water for women and 13 cups for men.</span><br><br>
            
            To make this simple&#44; drink a glass of water when you first wake up&#44; 
            drink another before each meal&#44; and sip on water throughout the day.  
            By doing this&#44; you will stay optimally hydrated. </p>

            The truth is&#44; what works for one person may not &#34;work&#34; for the 
            next.  Diets are ineffective&#44; and by prescribing yourself to a diet&#44; 
            you&#39;ve already got one foot in the weight regain grave&#44; so to speak. 
            Diets&#45;which are typically characterized by extreme overhauls&#44; 
            restrictive external rules&#44; and unsustainable habits&#45;may lead to 
            short&#45;term results&#44; but as soon as you start eating &#34;normally&#34; 
			&#40;read: processed junk food&#41; again&#44; you will regain the weight you 
            lost back&#45;and most often&#44; even more.<br><br>
            
            This is called &#34;Yo&#45;Yo Dieting.&#34;  The only approach that can help 
            you achieve true&#44; lasting results is tweaking your lifestyle and 
            building healthier habits that truly support your goals.<br><br>

			Overall&#44; nutrition is vital to successful results&#44; to optimizing 
            health&#44; to improving performance&#44; and to achieving the body of your 
            dreams.  It is also extremely important that you enjoy the food you are 
            eating and that your nutrition plan takes into consideration your personal 
            preferences and food aversions.<br><br>

			If you&#39;re anything like me&#44; you’ve scoured the Internet&#44; magazines&#44; 
            and books to find the &#34;best&#34; diet. Take a look back at your previous 
            attempts&#44; and honestly think about the following question&#58; <span class="spantxt3">How did 
            those plans work for you&#63;</span> <br><br>

			My guess is that if you&#39;re here reading this&#44; then the answer 
            to that question is something along the lines of&#44; &#34;Not so much.&#34;
            Or&#44; at best&#44; they &#34;worked&#34; for you in the short&#45;term&#44; only leading 
            you right back to where you started&#45;or worse.<br><br>

			The truth is that the best diet is the one that you can stick to. 
            That’s right&#44; researchers have compared nearly every major diet plan 
            out there&#44; and they found that there&#39;s very little difference in terms 
            of results. The most important factor&#44; they find&#44; is adherence&#44; or the 
            ability of folks to consistently meet program goals for diet and 
            physical activity.</p>
            
          <div class="yellowbox4">
            	<p class="yb4txt1">With that being said&#44; there are some common themes 
                among the most effective nutrition plans:</p>
                <ul class="yb4list">
                	<li>They raise awareness and attention</li>
                    <li>They focus on food quality</li>
                    <li>They help eliminate nutrient deficiencies</li>
                    <li>They help control appetite and food intake</li>
                    <li>They emphasize regular exercise</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>As you can see&#44; the first step in improving your nutrition 
            is less about the &#34;what&#34; and &#34;how much&#34; as it is changing how you 
            eat. This is a tool that you can take with you anywhere&#44; no matter 
            what or with whom you&#39;re eating. Checking in&#44; slowing down&#44; and eating 
            until you&#39;re about 80&#37; full makes your body the boss&#44; and it helps 
            you learn appetite awareness&#45;distinguishing when you feel that you 
            want eat&#44; need to eat&#44; and have eaten enough &#40;or&#44; too much&#41;.<br><br>

			Despite the fact that most people think that a good nutrition 
            plan should involve extensive suffering and restriction&#44; the 
            fact of the matter is that when you focus on building your 
			nutrition around healthful&#44; wholesome foods &#40;like those listed below&#45;&#44; you 
            can actually eat MORE&#44; not less. That&#39;s right&#44; when you ditch processed &#34;junk&#34; 
            foods and replace them with plenty of lean protein&#45;dense foods&#44; low&#45;energy&#45;dense 
            veggies&#44; and healthy fats&#44; you&#39;ll be improve appetite control&#44; overall health&#44; 
            and body composition.</p>

                <p><strong  style="color:#561d92;">Rule of thumb…</strong> The easiest way to be sure you&#39;re getting 
                healthy nutrition is by preparing food yourself.  Always keep your 
                cupboards stocked with healthy foods. Creating a healthy food 
                environment is one of the most important keys to success. According to 
                renowned nutritionist John Berardi&#44; the number one rule of good nutrition 
                is the following: <br><br>
                
               <strong style="color:#561d92">  <em> &#34;If a food is in your house or possession&#44; either you&#44; 
                someone you love&#44; or someone you marginally tolerate will eventually 
                eat it.&#34;</em></strong> <br><br>
                
                Get rid of the garbage and set up yourself for success by making 
                healthy food options readily available…after all&#44; the rule above 
                has a corollary&#58;<br><br>
                
                <strong style="color:#561d92">  <em>“If a healthy food is in your house or your possession&#44; 
                either you&#44;

			<p>One of the most common excuses that I hear from folks is: 
          	<span class="spantxt3">&#34;I don&#39;t have time; I&#39;m just too busy right now.&#34;</span><br><br>
            <img src="images/img15.jpg" alt="" class="img2-mob hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg">
            I get it; being &#34;busy&#34; is the buzzword of the 21st century. 
            However&#44;  as author Tim Kreider says&#44; being busy is not the same 
            as being productive&#44; and it is often &#34;a boast disguised as a 
            complaint&#34;&#45;and an excuse. But it&#39;s not a good excuse to not take 
            care of yourself.<br><br>
            
            It is important to block off time for yourself to do 
            something active… bike&#44; run&#44; walk&#44; play tennis…anything that 
            gets you moving.  Treat the time like you would a doctor&#39;s 
			apportionment or an important meeting for work; write it on the 
            calendar so everyone knows you are busy at that time.<br><br>

            Regular physical activity can positively impact nearly every 
            aspect of life. Exercise plays an important role in 
            cardiovascular health and disease risk&#44; carbohydrate tolerance 
            and insulin sensitivity&#44; strength and flexibility&#44; mental health 
            and cognitive function&#44; weight management&#44; feelings of
            wellbeing&#44; energy levels&#44; vitality&#44; quality of life&#44; and much&#44; much more.

            slow you down; it drains you of your energy and ambitions 
            in your daily life.  But losing weight is like a shock of 
            electricity&#45;it truly energizes you&#33;<br><br>

			Everyone needs to exercise; the benefits are truly indisputable&#44; 
            and nothing makes you feel more alive than getting your heart

         <p class="txt4">A Body in Motion Will Stay in Motion</p>
            
         <p>Simply put&#44; the best time to exercise is when you have time; 
            however&#44; I feel that most folks will find that scheduling time to 
            exercise first thing in the morning&#45;before the rest of your life 
            &#40;your kids&#44; your job&#44; errands you have to run&#44; the overall daily grind&#41; 
            gets in the way&#45;is best.  What&#39;s more&#44; studies show that exercising first 
            thing in the morning on an empty stomach can burn up to 33% more fat&#44; 
            and on top of that&#44; boost fat burning another 50% up to 8 hours after 
            exercise. <span class="spantxt3">That&#39;s what I call afterburn&#33;</span> <br><br>

			Unfortunately&#44; just like most diets are unsustainably restrictive&#44; 
            most exercise programs today are way too long. Statistics show that 
            individuals who exercise for just 20 &#45; 30 minutes a day are more consistent 
            with their workouts than those who spend 45 minutes or more working out. 
            Along those lines&#44; more and more studies are demonstrating that you don&#39;t 
            need to spend hours upon hours exercising to achieve your health and 
            weight loss goals. Along those lines&#44; high&#45;intensity interval training 
            is a time&#45;efficient exercise strategy that can promote cardiovascular 
            fitness and health&#44; insulin sensitivity and metabolic health&#44; 
            body composition&#44; and more. So keep it short&#33;</p>

            supercharging. Simply put&#44; your body is hard&#45;wired to combat

            These are fundamental adaptations&#44; but the good news is that

        Like caffeine&#44; <strong style="color:#561d92;">green tea extract</strong> has been shown to increase 
        the body&#39;s fat burning both during exercise and at rest&#45;even 
        while you sleep&#33; What&#39;s neat is that these effects are independent 
        of caffeine. In other words&#44; green tea extract and caffeine can work 
		synergistically to boost metabolism and fat burning.<br><br>
        
        In one study&#44; participants supplementing a reduced&#45;calorie 
        diet with a green tea extract for 8 weeks experienced a 
        2&#45;fold increase in metabolic rate&#44; leading to two times greater 
        weight loss compared to the placebo group &#40;i.e.&#44; diet alone&#41;.<br><br>
 
        In addition&#44; research shows that supplementation with green tea 
        extract can also help improve appetite control and reduce hunger&#44; 
        and what&#39;s more&#44; studies show that <span class="spantxt3">green tea extract can also

       		<p>Speaking of which&#44; carbohydrate tolerance and

            aging&#44; vitality&#44; feelings of wellbeing&#44; and much&#44; much more.<br><br>
            
            Studies consistently show that cinnamon is markedly effective 
            at improving carbohydrate tolerance and insulin sensitivity. In 
            one randomized&#44; double&#45;blind&#44; placebo&#45;controlled study&#44; participants 
            taking a <strong style="color:#561d92">cinnamon bark extract</strong> twice daily for two months experienced 
            an improvement in carbohydrate tolerance that was 300% greater than 
            the placebo group. <br><br>
            
            <img src="images/img20.jpg" alt="" class="rgtimg hidden-xs">
            <img src="images/img20.jpg" alt="" class="img2-mob hidden-lg hidden-md hidden-sm">  
            In another placebo&#45;controlled study&#44; participants taking a 
            cinnamon bark extract twice daily for 12 weeks experienced 
            significantly improved carbohydrate tolerance &#40;both compared to 
            baseline and placebo&#41;&#44; and even though this wasn&#39;t a weight loss 
            study&#44; the folks taking the cinnamon significantly improved body 
            composition.<br><br> 
            
            Regular moderate coffee consumption is linked to better 
            insulin sensitivity and carbohydrate tolerance&#44; reduced blood 
            pressure and body weight&#44; better cardiovascular health&#44; and 
            improved cognitive function. <br><br> 

            Because some of these findings have been associated with 
            both regular and decaffeinated coffee&#44; researchers attribute 
            them to specific polyphenols found in coffee called chlorogenic acid.<br><br>

            <strong style="color:#561d92">Green coffee extract</strong> is a decaffeinated extract that is standardized 
            for chlorogenic acid&#44; which has been shown to reduce the absorption of 
            carbohydrates from the digestive tract&#44; thereby improving carbohydrate tolerance.<br><br>
            
            In one study&#44; participants taking chlorogenic acid&#45;enriched 
            instant coffee daily for 12 weeks lost over 3 times more weight 
            than folks taking decaffeinated instant coffee. In a review of
            multiple studies investigating the effectiveness of green coffee 
            extract&#44; researchers concluded that&#44; on average&#44; supplementation 
            with green coffee extract leads to upwards of 5 pounds more 
            weightloss compared to placebo groups.<br><br>
            
            Olive leaves have been widely used in traditional remedies in 
            European and Mediterranean countries. Research shows that olive 
            leaf extract can significantly improve carbohydrate metabolism by 
            reducing the body’s ability to digest and absorb carbs.<br><br>

            <strong style="color:#561d92">Olive leaf extract</strong> has also been shown to promote the release 
            of a hormone called <span class="spantxt4">GLP&#45;1&#44; which promotes insulin sensitivity</span>. 
            What&#39;s more&#44; GLP&#45;1 also promotes satiety and reduces appetite. Not 
            only does olive leaf extract promote improved carbohydrate tolerance&#44; it
